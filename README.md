# Bike Purchase Dashboard

## Overview
This Excel project analyses bike purchase data to gain insights into customer segments. It utilises pivot tables and a simple dashboard to visualise the data.

This is a quick initial dashboard created to practice Excel skills. More complex visualisations and analyses will be pursued in the future.

## Contents

`BikeBuyerProject.xlsx`: Pivot table summarising bike purchase data and Basic dashboard visualising insights into customer segments.

## Dashboard

Bar charts comparing bike purchase rates by Gender which can be filtered by marital status, region and education level
Line chart of the purchase rate by age
This is a basic start to data visualisation and dashboarding. Further iteration will include more advanced chart types, formatting, interactivity, and customisations.

## About the Project
This quick Excel project provided an opportunity to practice core skills like pivot tables, basic charts, and dashboards. The intent was to demonstrate the ability to glean and present top-level insights from data using Excel tools. More complex data modelling, analysis, and visualisations will be pursued over time to build dashboarding skills.
